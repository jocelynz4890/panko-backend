| Task Title | Instruction | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sign in and orient yourself | Please sign into the app and briefly describe what you think you can do from this first screen. | Tests whether the entry point and navigation affordances are self-explanatory, and whether users can quickly form a correct mental model of how to manage their dishes and cooking history (gulf of evaluation: interpreting what they see). |
| Find a dish you’ve cooked before | Imagine you want to revisit something you’ve made in the past. Find a dish you’ve already cooked and open its details, then briefly describe what you can see about previous times you made it. | Uses a realistic goal and checks whether people can navigate their own dish library and understand how the app organizes dishes versus individual cooking attempts, which is critical for using the app as a long-term cooking log. |
| Log a new attempt for an existing dish | For the same dish, add a new entry to record that you’re cooking it again today, including what you plan to change (or keep the same) and how you expect it to turn out. | Exercises the core “iterate on a dish” flow: creating a new attempt attached to an existing dish, capturing variation details and expectations, and revealing any friction in the data-entry workflow. |
| Create a new dish and its first attempt | Think of a meal you cook or want to start tracking. Create a new dish for it and add the first time you’re making it in the app, filling in ingredients, instructions, notes, and a rating. | Covers the initial setup path for a dish and its history, from creating the dish anchor to recording the first attempt, which is necessary before any future iteration can happen. |
| Plan when to cook a dish | Choose any dish you now have in the app and set things up so that the app shows you’re planning to cook it at a specific time in the next week. | Connects dish history to future planning using the app’s scheduling features, checking whether users understand how planning to cook maps onto the interface and how those plans relate back to specific dishes. |
| Adjust an existing cooking plan | Change your plans so that the cooking session you just set up is moved to a different day, and add a second cooking session for a different dish on the original date. | Tests users’ ability to modify existing cooking plans (edit/move items, handle conflicts), revealing whether the system provides clear feedback about what changed (gulf of evaluation). |
| Review upcoming cooking and past attempts | Using whatever screens you find helpful, tell me what you plan to cook in the next 7 days and, for at least one of those dishes, summarize how your past attempts have gone. | Tests whether users can read and interpret the combined view of upcoming cooking plans and historical attempts, and whether the links between planned sessions and dish histories support reflection and decision-making. |
