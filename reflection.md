One of the most significant benefits of working as a team was the exposure to different perspectives on the course material. We each interpreted concepts like Concepts and Syncs slightly differently. By comparing our ideas and debating different implementations, I was able to deepen my understanding on these concepts. For example, when we were designing our concepts, we debated whether to combine or separate certain concepts and certain actions violated the "modularity" rule of concepts.

Another aspect that made working as a team interesting was the use of AI tools. Using these tools on a team project introduced a new layer of complexity. Tools like Gemini LLM and Cursor helped accelerate our individual tasks, but they also created new challenges around code consistency and merge conflicts that required careful management.

Different AI tools and different prompting styles led to variations in code structure and formatting. For example, when we split up the implementation for the backend concepts and worked on them in parallel, we found that the structures were vastly different. When we met for our team meeting, we realized that we should all use the same prompts and tools to ensure consistency.

On the frontend, we took a different approach. Since Cursor was especially prone to generating code that diverged from the rest of our structure, we leaned heavily on pair programming. Meeting in person allowed us to guide the tool together, review changes as they happened, and keep everyone aligned on style and architecture. This not only reduced inconsistencies but also helped us learn from each other’s coding habits and troubleshooting strategies in real time.
