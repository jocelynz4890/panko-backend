I learned that it's really important to start coding with a well fleshed out plan. Completely understanding what would be on the frontend before implementing queries on the backend would've helped us in not having to create queries later on based on missing functionality. We ended up having to modify our concept implementations a bit to support functionality we wanted on the frontend like being able to assign book covers to recipe books and allowing users to delete and edit names. I also learned how important it is to be guided by your problem statement to limit scope creep and make more informed choices when choosing functionality to trade off when you have limited time to implement your app.

Working in a group made the work much more manageable, but it would've been much easier to handle if we were able to do frontend tasks in parallel more. A large part of our implementation process also involved testing and catching bugs on the deployed website, and then fixing them on the frontend. This was a long and tedious process since we couldn't really fix things in parallel, because issues were oftentimes linked to one another, or fixing one thing could mess up another (the issues being things like page formatting, things on the backend that didn't work as expected, etc.). We were able to initially implement and test our backend concepts very quickly though, because we worked in parallel. Having multiple opinions and people to ask when you have a question about how a concept should be structured or what features to prioritize/trade off made decision making much easier and faster. I learned that it was very very important to have in-person synchronous meetings, because they made it easier to stay focused but also allows you to get immediate feedback. When we tried to make decisions over text, they took much longer and issues were often left unresolved until we had our weekly in-person meeting. Overall, I much preferred working in a group than working alone.
