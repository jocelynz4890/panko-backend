### Recipe Concept

- purpose: record individual attempts at preparing a dish, including context and outcome, so that the cook can compare attempts, learn from variations, and see how their results change over time.
- principle: each time a user prepares a dish, they create a new recipe entry that captures when it was made, any photos of the result, notes about what they did (or changed) compared to their usual approach, and how satisfied they were with the outcome. Over many cooking sessions, these recipes accumulate into a chronological history of attempts for that dish. When the user is deciding how to make the dish again, they review the previous recipes to see which variations turned out best and what they want to repeat or avoid, then create a new recipe entry for the latest attempt to extend the history.

    - a `dish` of type `Dish`
- actions:
  - createRecipe (ingredientsList: String, subname: String, pictures: Path, date: Date, instructions: String, note: String, ranking: Ranking, dish: Dish): (recipe: Recipe)
    - requires: ranking is between 1 and 5
    - effects: creates a new recipe entry with the given arguments
