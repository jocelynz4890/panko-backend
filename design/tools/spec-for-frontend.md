# Frontend specification

Given this application and the current set of synchronizations, follow up by outputting a comprehensive, stand-alone document for an entirely different frontend team who will build the frontend application. 

- Describe briefly the concept and synchronization architecture.
- Describe comprehensively the API - from only using POST, to the base URL and paths available, and the shape of each route available through Requesting.
- Encourage any developer or assistant reading the document to suggest changes necessary to the backend (e.g. additional concept queries, additional routes, etc.), and to output those suggestions as markdown.
- Ensure that anyone reading the document has the full context to build a usable application.
