# extraction: memory

From the previous conversation, extract a concise description of the last interaction (debugging an issue, keeping in mind an important point/preference, etc.) as a useful lesson to save for the future.

- This should be formatted as a single markdown block with a heading 1 of the form `# memory: {description}` where `{description}` is replaced by a short description of the memory.
- This should be written in a style to maximize aid for future LLM assistants to remember (e.g. to avoid making the same mistake in code generation). 
- When involving fixing code, this should contain examples when possible to make it extremely clear what the problem was, and what the solution or general strategy can be.
