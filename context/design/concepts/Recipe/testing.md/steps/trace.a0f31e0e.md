# trace:

1. **Creation**: The user creates a recipe "Mushroom Risotto" with tags in the description. This establishes the "named anchor" mentioned in the principle.
2. **History Accumulation**: The user adds `attempt1`. Later, they add `attempt2`. The concept state now holds `{ snapshots: [attempt1, attempt2] }`. This fulfills the principle of "review the sequence of attempts".
3. **Refinement**: The user designates `attempt2` as the default (the current standard for the dish).
4. **Evolution**: The user updates the name to "Perfect Mushroom Risotto" and updates tags to "Mastered". This fulfills the principle of "update the name or tags... as their tastes and habits evolve".
5. **Verification**: The final state query confirms the new name, the existence of multiple snapshots, and the correct default.
