# Commenting

Every action should have a comment including its signature, its requirements, and effects:

```typescript
  /**
   * createLabel (name: String): (label: Label)
   *
   * **requires** no Label with the given `name` already exists
   *
   * **effects** creates a new Label `l`; sets the name of `l` to `name`; returns `l` as `label`
   */
```

```
concept Authentication

    purpose authenticate users so that each user of the app is a real person

    principle a user is authorized to access their profile only if they provide the correct username and password set during registration

    state
        a set of Users with
            a username String
            a hashed password String

    actions
        register (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
            requires no user exists with given username
            effect creates and stores a new User with the given username and hashed password, returns the new user

        authenticate (username: String, password: String): (user: User, token: String)
            requires a user to exist with the given username
            effects if a user with the given username exists and the given password matches the user's password then the user is authenticated and a session token is generated. Otherwise, access is denied.

        validateToken (user:User, token:String):(user:User)
            requires user exists and token matches
            effects verifies that user if authenticated.
```
