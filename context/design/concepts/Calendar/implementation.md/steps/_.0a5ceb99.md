# Commenting

Every action should have a comment including its signature, its requirements, and effects:

```typescript
  /**
   * createLabel (name: String): (label: Label)
   *
   * **requires** no Label with the given `name` already exists
   *
   * **effects** creates a new Label `l`; sets the name of `l` to `name`; returns `l` as `label`
   */
```

### Calendar

* purpose: let a person commit planned dishes to specific dates so they can see at a glance what is coming up and avoid forgetting what they intended to cook on a given day.
* principle: when a person decides they want to make a particular dish on a specific day, they create a calendar entry that links that plan to the chosen date.
* state:
  * a set of ScheduledRecipes
    * a `user` of type `User`
    * a `snapshot` of type `Snapshot`
    * a `date` of type `Date`
* actions:
  * assignSnapshotToDate(snapshot: Snapshot, date: Date)
    * requires: snapshot exists
    * effects: adds snapshot to ScheduledRecipes with given date
  * deleteScheduledRecipe(scheduledRecipe: ScheduledRecipe)
    * requires: scheduledRecipe exists
    * effects: deletes the given scheduledRecipe
  * deleteAllScheduledRecipesWithSnapshot(snapshot:Snapshot)
    * requires: True
    * effects: finds all ScheduledRecipes associated with the given snapshot and deletes them
