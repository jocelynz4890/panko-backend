# Legible testing

* Each test should output what it is doing and the trace of any actions, to help with debugging and increasing confidence that the concept or action is doing what it says.
* Principle tests and tests involving multiple actions should explain how it aligns with expectations.
* For action tests, the output should explain how requirements are met and how effects are confirmed.

```
concept Authentication

    purpose authenticate users so that each user of the app is a real person

    principle a user is authorized to access their profile only if they provide the correct username and password set during registration

    state
        a set of Users with
            a username String
            a hashed password String

    actions
        register (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
            requires no user exists with given username
            effect creates and stores a new User with the given username and hashed password, returns the new user

        authenticate (username: String, password: String): (user: User, token: String)
            requires a user to exist with the given username
            effects if a user with the given username exists and the given password matches the user's password then the user is authenticated and a session token is generated. Otherwise, access is denied.

        validateToken (user:User, token:String):(user:User)
            requires user exists and token matches
            effects verifies that user if authenticated.
