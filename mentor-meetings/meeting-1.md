## Issues

- what should be addressed in project pitch video? show VSD/other aspects of functional design?
  - up to you, validate that we have a problem
  - explain why our solution is good way to solve it
- scope of project? how many concepts?
  - 3-5ish
- do we need friending if our app emphasizes individual experiences? could it be implemented after our MVP?
  - we don't need friending

Feedback on probem framing:

  - scope down by writing a user journey
- versioning feature is unique
