# Meeting 2

## Agenda

Sunday, November 23
3 pm

## Progress Report

- finished functional design and project video asynchronously
- individually submitted peer critiques
- had an in person meeting where we all worked on implementing our app; we finished a draft of the backend and started the front end

## Design changes

- narrowed scope of problem to focus on iterative cooking

## Issues

- how should we handle images for our snapshot concept?
- we sometimes get an error with TLS connection, we arent sure how to fix this.
- do we have to implement feedback if we can justify our choices?
- is it ok to have recipes and snapshots as seperate concepts?
- how should we format our syncs?

## Plans and Decisions

Decisions made:

- decided not to implement imported or AI generated recipes to focus on the core functionality of our app focused on solving the problem of iterative cooking

Plans for next week:

- finish checkpoint alpha
