- Frequency, length and location of team meetings;

- How will the quality of work be maintained (reviewing each others’ code? team review meetings? pair programming?);
  - We will review each others’ code to ensure each of our parts are cohesive.
  - When we merge code, we will review the code to make sure the app is still functioning.
  - We will make sure to make lots of commits and work on separate branches.
  - If there are major issues, we will schedule emergency meetings to go through the code and debug.
- How tasks will be assigned, and what to do if deadlines are missed;
  - Tasks will be assigned at weekly meetings based on preferences.
  - If deadlines are missed, we will help each other out as much as possible.
    - We will communicate if we think we cannot complete a task in time.
- How decisions will be made and any disagreements resolved.
  - Major decisions will be decided at weekly meetings and minor decisions that come up can be discussed asynchronously.
  - For disagreements, we will try our best to compromise or ask our mentor for advice to make more informed decisions.
